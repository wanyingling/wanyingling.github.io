My research operates at the intersection of demography, sociology, and epidemiology. I employ a wide variety of multi-source data—including census records, social surveys, biographies, and biomarkers—alongside quantitative and computational methods to delve into these topics.

## Social epidemiology orientation

Ddentifying how work and family structures shape health and subjective well-being

## Formal demography orientation

Using life expectancy and derived indicators to map population-level patterns and temporal change

### **Relevant working papers and publications**:

- Expansion or compression? Understanding inequalities in healthy life expectancy for the Chinese elderly from a life course perspective.

## Computational social science

Leveraging novel data and analytic strategies to link micro-level behavior to macro-level patterns

### **Relevant working papers and publications**:

- **Wanying Ling**, Sizhan Cui. 2025. [The Limits of Replication: The Possibility and Feasibility of Silicon Samples (In Chinese)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/392734394_fuxiandexianduguijiyangbendekenengyukewei_The_Limits_of_Replication_The_Possibility_and_Feasibility_of_Silicon_Samples). Journal of Intelligent Society.

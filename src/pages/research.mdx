My research investigates how work and family life shape people’s health. It sits at the intersection of the sociology of work, social demography, and social epidemiology.

## The Sociology of Work Orientation

Focusing on working-time mismatch and non-standard work arrangements in contemporary labor markets, and examining how these working conditions affect workers’ health and wellbeing.

## Social Demography Orientation

Analyzing how different types of wealth and liabilities influence family formation processes, and how these resource configurations in turn shape the health and wellbeing of individuals and families.

## Social Epidemiology Orientation

Using a wide range of health indicators to describe how health inequalities emerge and accumulate over the life course.
